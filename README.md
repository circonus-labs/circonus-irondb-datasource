### IRONdb Type
* Standalone: An IRONdb cluster accessible directly, requires entry of Account ID.
* Hosted: An IRONdb instance hosted by Circonus, requires entry of API token.
 
### Account ID
The Account ID associated with the account to pull metrics from.

### API Token
The API Token associated with the account to pull metrics from. This can be found on your API Tokens page after logging in at [https://www.circonus.com/](https://www.circonus.com/) in the "User Profile" section.

## Usage

1. Create a new panel and set the datasource to name selected in the IRONdb datasource configuration.

### Normal Queries
For normal queries, use the metric browser to navigate the metric hierarchy of your IRONdb instance or type queries manually using the *Toggle Edit Mode* menu item to the right.

### CAQL Queries
[CAQL queries](https://login.circonus.com/resources/docs/user/CAQL.html) must be entered manually by selecting the *CAQL* checkbox or switching manually to the editor mode.

### Histograms
Histograms currently require a special checkbox to be selected in order for the returned data to be processed correctly.

Once selected, histogram data processing will be utilized for any returned data related to the specific metric.

### Heatmaps
Using the histogram checkbox to process returned data allows for histograms to be displayed on the heatmap panel type.

For this processed data to be displayed on the heatmap panel as the sample above, select *Time Series Buckets* as the Data Format to be used on the Heatmap panel.

### Template Variables

**How to configure a template variable for IRONdb**

1. From a dashboard, click `Settings` in the top right.
  
1. On the left hand side, select the `Variables` section.
  
1. Click `+New` and choose a name for your new variable.
  
1. Select the proper data source: `IRONdb`.
  
1. Under `Query`, enter the metric you wish to use in this variable (without tags), **or** enter the fully formed tag query, ala: `and(__name:foo,or(bar:baz,quux:*))`.  Note that this query can contain references to other variables (see example below)
  
1. If you enable `Include All Option`, enter `*` for the `Custom all value`.
  
1. Click `Enabled` under `Value groups/tags` to enable tags support.
  
1. Enter the tag category you wish to use in your variable under `Tag values query`.  See example below.
  
1. If you successfully completed the prior steps, `Preview of values` should now auto-complete the tag values.
  
1. Finish setup by clicking `Add` and then `Save`.

Example:

![](img/irondb-variable-config.png)

In this example, we are creating a variable called `namespace` using the query `and(__name:used,cluster:$cluster)` which contains a reference to another variable (not pictured).  We are then pulling the values out of a tag also called `namespace` (you can see the preview values).

In this way you can make dependent variables that change in a hierarchy based on prior chosen variables.
  
Your new template variable should now appear in the query builder!
