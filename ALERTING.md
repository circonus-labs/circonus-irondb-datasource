# Alerts & Plugin Signing

To activate Grafana's Alerting features, a "backend" plugin is required. Since v7.0, "Grafana now [requires backend plugins to be signed](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/upgrading/#backend-plugins)." Or you can [turn off signature checks](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/plugins/plugin-signatures/#allow-unsigned-plugins). If you aren't sure which option is right for you, ask your security department. If you think you don't have one of those, congratulations, *you* are the security department. Read through the information linked above (I'll wait) and choose the relevant section below.

## Building the Backend

Unless otherwise noted, the commands below should be run from your git checkout or unzipped plugin directory.

The steps below will build the Circonus IronDB Datasource plugin and load it into a local Docker container.

### Metadata

There are a few things to modify and install before we're ready to build. The first is `src/plugin.json`, which contains plugin metadata in JSON format for Grafana. We need to add three top-level keys, as shown below:

```
--- a/src/plugin.json
+++ b/src/plugin.json
@@ -2,6 +2,9 @@
   "type": "datasource",
   "name": "IRONdb",
   "id": "circonus-irondb-datasource",
+  "backend": true,
+  "executable": "irondb-backend",
+  "alerting": true,

   "info": {
     "description": "Datasource plugin to pull data from an IRONdb installation.",
```

These three keys tell Grafana 1) `"backend": true` that this plugin contains a backend component, 2) `"executable": "irondb-backend"` what the backend component is named, and 3) `"alerting": true` that the backend component supports alerting.

The frontend needs to be rebuilt to incorporate these new changes as well:

```
$ npm install -g @grafana/toolkit
$ yarn build
```

The shortcut to build everything and sign for local testing is:

```
$ docker/build-local.sh
```

### The Build

Building the backend component is done using a tool called [mage](https://github.com/magefile/mage#readme). Once you've followed the installation instructions, run the following command, which should show very similar output:

```
$ mage -v
Running dependency: github.com/grafana/grafana-plugin-sdk-go/build.Build.Linux-fm
Running dependency: github.com/grafana/grafana-plugin-sdk-go/build.Build.LinuxARM64-fm
Running dependency: github.com/grafana/grafana-plugin-sdk-go/build.Build.Darwin-fm
Running dependency: github.com/grafana/grafana-plugin-sdk-go/build.Build.Windows-fm
Running dependency: github.com/grafana/grafana-plugin-sdk-go/build.Build.LinuxARM-fm
exec: go build -o dist/irondb-backend_darwin_amd64 -ldflags -w -s -extldflags "-static" ./pkg
exec: go build -o dist/irondb-backend_linux_amd64 -ldflags -w -s -extldflags "-static" ./pkg
exec: go build -o dist/irondb-backend_linux_arm -ldflags -w -s -extldflags "-static" ./pkg
exec: go build -o dist/irondb-backend_linux_arm64 -ldflags -w -s -extldflags "-static" ./pkg
exec: go build -o dist/irondb-backend_windows_amd64.exe -ldflags -w -s -extldflags "-static" ./pkg
```

The backend component is now ready to use.

## Plugin Signing

Follow either this step or the next one (Allow Unsigned Plugins), not both.

We'll be using "private" signing here, which is the default. This means we need to specify a list of one or more domains where this build is valid for use. The example below uses `localhost`, for simplicity. This should contain the base url your users will load to use the plugin.

The first step is to [create a grafana.com account and api key](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/plugins/sign-a-plugin/) and set it in your environment.

These steps use the signing tool provided by a globally-installed `@grafana/toolkit`.

```
$ cd "$GRAFANA_PLUGINS/circonus-irondb-datasource"
$ export GRAFANA_API_KEY=424242424242424242424242424242424242424242424242
$ export GRAFANA_TOOLKIT=$(find $(npm root -g) -type f -iname "grafana-toolkit.js")
$ node $GRAFANA_TOOLKIT plugin:sign --rootUrls http://localhost:3000/
```

## Allow Unsigned Plugins

Follow either this step or the previous one (Plugin Signing), not both.

This option requires a Grafana config change. Find your [config location](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/configuration/), and make sure your config contains the following:

```
[plugins]
allow_loading_unsigned_plugins = circonus-irondb-datasource
```

## Alerting Test

Let's load the plugin we've configured & built into Grafana running in Docker. This requires a CIRCONUS_API_KEY to be set in your environment, and assumes the account that key provides access to has 1+ metrics named `duration`.

```
$ docker/run-local.sh
```

Now we can hit http://localhost:3000, and check out the preconfigured `irondb test` dashboard, which should start alerting immediately if the `duration` metric's value is 200 or more.
